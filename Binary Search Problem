Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        left=0
        right=len(nums)-1
        while left<=right:
            mid=(left+right)//2

            if nums[mid]==target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid]>target:
                right=mid-1
            else:
                left=mid+1
        return -1


TestCase:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: 0 exists in nums and its index is 1
